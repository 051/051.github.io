        <h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h4>What's a puzzle, and how do I solve one?</h4>
		<p>
			In summary, in each puzzle you'll get some information, and you have to extract an answer out of it, which is 
			usually an English word or phrase. The puzzles usually come without explicit instructions, so part of the challenge
			is in figuring out what to do with what you have.
		</p>
		<p>
			Additionally, this handy <a href="../guide">solving guide</a> contains some helpful pointers on approaching puzzles!
		</p>
		<h4>Will I need to be available and active all throughout the hunt?</h4>
		<p>
			Nope! The puzzles will be available for the entire duration of the event (and even after), so you can work through
			them at your own pace.
		</p>
		<h4>How many puzzles will this hunt contain?</h4>
		<p>
			7.
		</p>
		<h4>Are there any prizes?</h4>
		<p>
			Yes! The top three teams will win GrabFood vouchers.
		</p>
		<h4>I have a question that's not listed here!</h4>
		<p>
			Feel free to drop me a message on Telegram if you have any other queries!
