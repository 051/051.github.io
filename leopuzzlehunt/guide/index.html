		<small><em>Adapted from betaveros' <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts">Introduction to Puzzlehunts</em></a>.</small>
		<h2>What's a puzzle?</h2>
		<p>
			Broadly speaking, a puzzle is a collection of information which, by following a series of appropriate
			steps, can be turned into a final answer, which is almost always an English word or phrase. Puzzles
			<em>mostly</em> don't come with instructions, though often it's possible to approach them by recognizing
			familiar elements of their structure. For example, if a puzzle comes with a list of clues, you might
			want to	solve them; if a puzzle has a familiar type of puzzle in it, like a crossword or a Sudoku, you
			could try solving it and seeing where it leads.
		</p>
		<p>
			Puzzles also generally adhere to a consistent structure, comprising a <em>title</em>, <em>flavor
			text</em> and the main <em>puzzle content</em> itself.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><p>The <em>title</em> of a puzzle generally relates to the puzzle in some broad way; sometimes
				it just describes the puzzle content, but sometimes it's a hint or helps to confirm that you're
				on the right track. In general, the puzzles in this hunt have largely non-hintful titles.</p></li>
			<li><p>The <em>flavor text</em> of a puzzle manifests as some words just before the main puzzle content,
				and generally hints at some aspect of a puzzle, whether it's a step that has to be taken or some
				realisation that has to be made.</p></li>
			<li><p>The <em>puzzle content</em> contains the main meat of the puzzle and can be just about anything, 
				from a crossword grid to a blob of text to a bunch of numbers. This is what you're working with!</p></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The puzzles in this puzzle hunt also contain some extra story to give some context to the puzzles, as
			well as a question (in bold, right after the story) which can be answered by the puzzle's answer, to
			help you ensure you're on the right track.
		</p>
		<h2>Extracting an answer</h2>
		<p>
			Since a puzzle has to end in a single answer, there must be a way to translate puzzle information into a
			final answer (or a phrase that hints the answer, or even just a next step). Some common ways to extract
			an answer:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Checking <b>first letters</b> can often reveal valuable information. A lot of puzzles spell out
					their final answer through first letters of answers to individual clues or something similar.
					Sometimes, the first letters of the clues might spell out a message as well.</p></li>
				<li><p>Some <b>encodings</b> show up often; common examples include binary, Braille, and Morse. These don't 
					always explicitly in their typical form; black or shaded squares in a grid could represent Braille, for
					example. Puzzles will typically hint at the type of encoding used, if any, though; Braille often comes
					with references to blindness or otherwise being unable to see, while Morse code could be hinted at with
					mention of a "transmission" or anything "short and long". Here's a helpful
					<b><a href="http://www.puzzledpint.com/files/3614/6881/3541/CodeSheet_07_2016.pdf">codesheet (PDF)</a></b>
					that may come in handy!</p></li>
			</ul>
		<h2>Calling in an answer</h2>
		<p>
			Answer guesses in this hunt can be submitted via the page linked at the top-right hand corner of each puzzle 
			page! You should get immediate feedback on whether your answer was correct or wrong; if you're having trouble
			getting the answer checker to work, you can drop me a message at <a href="https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@gyz_tm">@gyz_tm</a>
			on Telegram and I'll see what I can do!
		</p>
		<h2>Need a hint?</h2>
