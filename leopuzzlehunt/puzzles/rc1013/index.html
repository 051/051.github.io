        <h1>RC1013 Planet Colonization</h1>
		<p>
			You rush into class, a little late; your professor's already started the lesson. "...as you
			know, Earth recently colonized the N1K-071 galaxy, and we've commenced the process of setting
			up infrastructure on the planets there. Importantly, we've set up an interplanetary rail
			network system that facilitates high-speed travel between different colonies. All that's left
			to do is deploy our fleet of security starships!"
		</p>
		<div class="qn">
			What might this interplanetary rail network be called?
		</div>
		<hr>
		<p>
			It's time to deploy our fleet of 24 starships across this system! There's just a 
			few things we should keep in mind to ensure our resources are well-distributed:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>There should be two starships in each bold-outlined region.</li>
			<li>There should be two starships in each column.</li>
			<li>There should be two starships in each row.</li>
			<li>No two starships can be placed next to each other, whether adjacent or diagonally.</li>
		</ul>
