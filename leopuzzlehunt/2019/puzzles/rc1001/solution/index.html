		<h3>Answer: <font color="green">EL CAPITAN</font></h3>
		<p>
			This puzzle presents solvers with a series of lines of boxes, connected by lines. Solvers might
			intuit (and indeed most did) that boxes connected by lines must contain the same letter, but this
			observation alone won't get solvers much progress, since many letter patterns are quite ambiguous.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next jump to make comes from the flavor text's mention of "friendship" and "ship": one might
			realise that each word in the puzzle can have the word "ship" appended to it to create a new word.
			This disambiguates some of the words: for example, the third line's xAyyLE can be uniquely identified
			as BATTLE, as opposed to some other word like BAFFLE or DABBLE.
		</p>
		<p>
			After filling in all the words, the letters from the 9 boxes with numbers in them can be arranged
			in order (either by number or color) to spell out the final answer <b>EL CAPITAN</b>.

			Here's the diagram, when fully filled out correctly:
