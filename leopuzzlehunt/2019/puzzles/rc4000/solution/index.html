        <h1>Solution: RC4000 Reaching Conclusions</h1>
		<h3>Answer: <font color="green">REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS</font></h3>
		<p>
			The feeder answers for this puzzle are:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li>EL CAPITAN</li>
				<li>CONTEXT MENU</li>
				<li>CHANNEL SURFING</li>
				<li>DANIEL DEFOE</li>
				<li>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA</li>
				<li>HIT THE ROAD JACK</li>
			</ul>
		<p>
			Each of these answers can be associated with a phrase with the initials RC. This
			is mildly hinted at by the title of the puzzle as well as the flavor text ("really
			confusing"); additionally, the course code numbers of the puzzle titles are ordered
			13-1-11-5-18-3 in this puzzle, which can be converted to their corresponding letters
			in the alphabet to spell out MAKE RC. Apart from these subtler hints, the main way
			solvers were meant to find this connection was by Google searching their answers
			and noticing phrases that fit in the blanks provided. For example, DANIEL DEFOE
			fairly unambiguously connects to ROBINSON CRUSOE, and HIT THE ROAD JACK turns up
			a fair number of mentions of RAY CHARLES.
		</p>
		<p>
			The full list of associated RC phrases is as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>EL CAPITAN: <b>ROCK CLIMBING</b> &mdash; El Capitan is a popular route among rock climbers</li>
				<li>CONTEXT MENU: <b>RIGHT CLICK</b> &mdash; The context menu is what shows up when you right-click</li>
				<li>CHANNEL SURFING: <b>REMOTE CONTROL</b> &mdash; The device most commonly associated with channel surfing</li>
				<li>DANIEL DEFOE: <b>ROBINSON CRUSOE</b> &mdash; Daniel Defoe is best known as the author of Robinson Crusoe</li>
				<li>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA: <b>ROLLER COASTER</b> &mdash; Battlestar Galactica is a ride at USS</li>
				<li>HIT THE ROAD JACK: <b>RAY CHARLES</b> &mdash; "Hit the Road Jack" is a song by Ray Charles</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The provided boxes can thus be filled out with these RC phrases as shown below. The numbers
			in the diagram range from 1 to 19; taking the letters associated with the numbers 1 to 19
			and putting them in that order yields the final answer, which is another RC phrase:
			<b>REGAIN CONSCIOUSNESS</b>. Turns out the entire day of weird classes was just a dream!
