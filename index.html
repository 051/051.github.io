			Hi, I'm Yang Ze! I'm most commonly known online as Level 51. In real life, I just graduated from
			the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science.
		</p>
		<h2>Pok&eacute;mon</h2>
		<p>
			I've been playing competitive Pokemon for over 10 years, including competing in the official Pok√©mon Championship Series since the first sanctioned tournament came to Singapore in 2015. I still play games now and then, but I'm mostly washed up nowadays.
		</p>
		<h2>Puzzles</h2>
		<p>
			I like solving puzzles and participating in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzlehunt">puzzle hunts</a>! I created, oversee, and write puzzles for <a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/">Silph Puzzle Hunt</a> (previously known as the Smogon Puzzle Hunt). You can find some selected puzzles I've written <a href="/puzzles">here</a>, including some of my favourite puzzles from the hunt.
