			Hi, I'm Yang Ze! I'm most commonly known online as Level 51. In real life, I'm currently in my freshman year at
			the National University of Singapore, pursuing a Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science.
		</p>
		<h2>Pok&eacute;mon</h2>
		<p>
			I've been playing competitive Pokemon for 9 years, including competing in the official Pok√©mon Championship Series
			since the first sanctioned tournament came to Singapore in 2015. You might be able to find some of my matches online
			with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=guan+yang+ze+pokemon">well-phrased YouTube search</a>.
			I still play games now and then, but I'm mostly washed up :')
		</p>
		<h2>Puzzles</h2>
		<p>
			I like solving puzzles and participating in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzlehunt">puzzle hunts</a>!
			I created, oversee, and write puzzles for the Smogon Puzzle Hunt (website pending), which runs every year around
			July. You can find some selected puzzles I've written for the hunt <a href="/puzzles">here</a>, alongside some
			puzzles I've written for various other purposes.
		</p>
		<h2>Programming</h2>
		<p>
			I'm pretty interested in, though not particularly good at, competitive programming! I mainly use
			<a href="https://open.kattis.com/users/level.51">Kattis</a> because I haven't gotten used to all the other sites yet,
			and also because CS3233 has a Kattis point requirement for some reason.
