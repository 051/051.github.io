		<h2>Puzzlehunt puzzles</h2>
        <p>If you've never heard of puzzlehunts, a brief idea is that they're sort of like escape rooms, but minus all the physical aspects, and generally lengthier and significantly more difficult (think a weekend-long event, rather than an hour or so). I like <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/puzzlehunts">this primer</a> as a slightly more extended dive into what puzzlehunts are.</p>
        <p>I've run and contributed puzzles to a few puzzlehunts over the years, primarily <a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/">Silph Puzzle Hunt</a>. According to my personal records I've written over 160 puzzles for 15+ separate hunts, but here are some of my favourites.</p>
        <ul>
			<li class="d-n"><a href="https://2021.silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/white-as-a-sheet">White as a Sheet</a> (2021): a puzzle that seems like it gives you nothing to work with.</li>
			<li class="d-h"><a href="https://2021.silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/the-minimeta-that-goes-wrong">The Minimeta that Goes Wrong</a> (2021): a chaotic minimeta where the constructor can't seem to catch a break.</li>
			<li class="d-h"><a href="https://2021.silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/six-feet-under">Six Feet Under</a> (2021): a labyrinthine collection of footnotes.</li>
			<li class="d-x"><a href="https://2021.silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/re-actions">Re-actions</a> (2021): a tough-as-nails cryptic crossword where you'll have to figure out how the clues fit together.</li>
            <li class="d-n"><a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/answering-machine">Answering Machine</a> (2025):  a perfectly normal list of cryptic crossword clues.</li>
            <li class="d-h"><a href="https://silphpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/sudoku-starter-pack">Sudoku Starter Pack</a> (2025): a Sudoku built on a happy coincidence.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <p>I also have a soft spot for <a href="/puzzles/secretsolver/christmascards/">Christmas Cards</a>, a half-puzzle, half-game "deckbuilder" I wrote for a Secret Santa-style puzzle-exchange event.</p>

        <h2>Cryptic crosswords</h2>
		<p>These are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptic_crossword">cryptic crosswords</a> with no hunt-style "final answer", though usually they have instructions for extracting one or more phrases from the grid.</p>
        <ul>
			<li class="d-n"><a href="/puzzles/The Two-Trench Truce.pdf">The Two-Trench Truce (PDF)</a>, written around the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.</li>
            <li class="d-h"><a href="/puzzles/Choose Your Path.pdf">Choose Your Path (PDF)</a>, written around the time of <em>Undertale</em>'s release on the Switch. <em>(Spoiler warning!)</em></li>
            <li class="d-h"><a href="/puzzles/Hexed Again!.pdf">Hexed Again! (PDF)</a>, written as part of a Secret Santa puzzle exchange for Christmas 2019.</a>
        </ul>
